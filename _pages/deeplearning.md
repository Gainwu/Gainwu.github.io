# Preface 
In the recent past, I have been recording my study notes in Notion. To facilitate my own review and organization later on, I will regularly organize the content here, which is also a form of open-source, allowing everyone to review the content written by the author (a beginner). Since it is a beginner's study, the learning content is for reference only. : )
