I’m a student who is exploring myself. This is my learning record blog, and I will record my thoughts and learnings here.

Thanks for coming. Let's work together and become better ourselves!

### Preface 
In the recent past, I have been recording my study notes in Notion. To facilitate my own review and organization later on, I will regularly organize the content here, which is also a form of open-source, allowing everyone to review the content written by the author (a beginner). Since it is a beginner's study, the learning content is for reference only. : )

  1. notion draft notes：[notion shared link](https://protective-morning-0bc.notion.site/129ee0e60378803ebfd6fa988800257f?pvs=4)
  2. Stage-by-stage organization is carried out on this website.
